# Hacktoberfest-AlabamaTeachers-2018

This repository is designed to aid teachers and anyone else that is new to GitHub and wants to learn more about the git flow of contributing to a project. This repository will have a file that is written in the Python programming language for you to contribute to. 

The process of contributing to a public repository follows the following steps:
1. Fork the repository into your account. What this will do is it creates a parallel work flow for you that does not affect the master repository. All of your changes only affect your files and do not affect anyone else's files.
2. To make changes, click on the pencil to type on your file. Then to save your changes, you will scroll down to the bottom to 'commit' your changes. This will save your changes in your repository.
3. When you're done making changes in your forked repository, you can then add your changes to the master repository. This is done by doing a pull request. To do a pull request, go to the master repository and click the button for a new pull request. Here is where you can compare changes that you made. You want to click the blue hyperlink 'compare across forks'. Use the drop down menus that appear now to navigate to your repository and create your pull request.
4. Now all you do is wait for the owner of the master repository to approve your changes and you contributed to an open-source repository using GitHub!
